# 📊 Clinical Trial Analytics Dashboard

## 📝 Project Description
This project is a **Clinical Trial Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Power BI** to analyze and monitor clinical trial data across multiple dimensions such as:
- Enrollment  
- Demographics  
- Visits & Compliance  
- Safety (Adverse Events)  
- Efficacy (Treatment Outcomes)

The dashboard provides an integrated analytical view to support **clinical operations, safety monitoring, and decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor **planned vs actual enrollment**
- Analyze **patient demographics**
- Track **visit compliance & protocol deviations**
- Identify **safety risks (Adverse Events)**
- Evaluate **treatment efficacy**
- Enable **site-level performance monitoring**

---

## 📄 Dashboard Pages
1. **Executive Overview** – High-level summary of trial performance  
2. **Demographics** – Age group, gender, comorbidities, and geographic distribution  
3. **Enrollment Analysis** – Site-wise enrollment, dropout reasons, and trends  
4. **Visits & Compliance** – Visit completion, missed visits, and deviations  
5. **Safety** – Adverse event analysis by severity, outcome, and site  
6. **Efficacy** – Treatment response and improvement analysis  

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Total Patients  
- Planned Enrollment  
- Actual Enrollment  
- Enrollment %  
- Dropout Count & %  
- Total Visits  
- Completed Visits %  
- Protocol Deviations  
- Total Adverse Events  
- Serious Adverse Events %  
- Response Rate %  
- Average Improvement  

---

## 🎛 Filters & Interactions
- Slicers: **Site, Study, Country, Year**
- Cross-filtering between visuals
- Page navigation for sections
- Highlighting of key sites and trends

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Data Modeling
- Custom Visuals (Rounded bars, Combo charts)

## 🔍 Sample Insights
- Enrollment performance varies significantly across sites.  
- Dropouts are mainly driven by consent withdrawal and adverse events.  
- Certain sites show higher protocol deviations, indicating compliance risks.  
- Serious adverse events are concentrated in specific sites.  
- Majority of evaluated patients show improvement, indicating treatment effectiveness.  

---

## 📈 Business Value
- Enables real-time monitoring of clinical trial performance  
- Supports site-level performance evaluation  
- Helps identify safety and compliance risks early  
- Assists in data-driven decision-making
